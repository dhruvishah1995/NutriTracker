# NutriTracker App

## Overview

NutriTracker is a cutting-edge application designed to assist you in monitoring your daily nutritional contents of ingredients used in your home-cooked meals. Leveraging the power of generative AI, NutriTracker offers accurate estimations of essential micronutrients, including sugar, fat, protein, fiber, cholesterol, and more, ensuring you can maintain a healthy diet tailored to your recipes.

## Motivation

In pursuit of dietary awareness, I often used ChatGPT to obtain nutritional values for ingredients in my recipes. However, frequent monitoring of micronutrients in home-cooked meals posed a challenge. This inspired me to develop an application using generative AI to address this need comprehensively, making the tracking of nutrients efficient and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Instant Nutritional Analysis**: Input ingredients of your recipes to receive immediate nutritional estimations.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes advanced AI models to predict detailed nutritional information.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Incorporates Redux for seamless state management across the application.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Designed with a user-friendly layout for straightforward data entry and result visualization.

This is our objective, and the work is in progress.
